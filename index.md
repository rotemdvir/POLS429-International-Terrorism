## Course Description
This is an upper-level course in International Relations (IR). The course offers an overview of the field of international relations. The primary purpose is to understand and evaluate the main theories, arguments, claims, and conjectures made by scholars in the field. The central question we will address is what are the main ways in which scholars organize and assess knowledge in the field? In the first half of the course, we will discuss the main theories used to understand international politics, including their application to central world events. In the second half, we go deeper on some specific issues such as international institutions, economic statecraft, and various aspects of international and national conflict including coercion, reputation, terrorism, modern technology and covert action.  

**Textbook**: Chenoweth Erica and Pauline Moore. 2018. *The Politics of Terror*. Oxford university press.
